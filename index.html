	 				<p>Ateş is a two year-old Golden Retriever who loves sleeping and going on walks. She has been with us since she was a newborn puppy and has been enduring endless love ever since.</p>

	 			<h2>Day In The life</h2>
	 				<p>In the morning, she likes to wakes the household by barking, signalling us that she wants to go out. When she finally goes outside, she loves to eat my mom's plants and play with her toys. Around noon, she gets ready to feast on our lunch with us and comes back wanting more and more each time. In the afternoon, we go out on a walk where she spends enjoyable times with her other dog friends. At last, she gets comfortable in her bad, ready to dream about another busy day.</p>
